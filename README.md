## **Project 1: Data Modeling with Postgres**
In this project, I applied Data Modeling with Postgres and built an ETL pipeline using Python. A startup wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. Currently, the start up is collecting data in H5 format and the analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.

## **Project 2: Data Modeling with Cassandra**
In this project, I applied Data Modeling with Cassandra and constructed an ETL pipeline via Python. A Data Model was constructed based on the queries to address the following:
1. Get details of a song that was heard on the music app history during a particul session
2. Get songs played by a user during a particular session on the music app
3. Get all users from the music app history who listened to a particular song
